<h1>Attempt at a second page</h1>
<body>
<div>This is another attempt at creating a page that I can edit. I want to try to impliment the various techniques I am learning across different apps.</div>
<p>I have used a div element and a p element</p>
<a href="third-page.html">Link to third page</a>
<div>Removing the "pages/ before the link allowed the link to the third page to work, but on the index or testing page, I specify the "pages" folder and it access the second page. They're all in the same local folder in the "working-on-terminal" folder.</div>
