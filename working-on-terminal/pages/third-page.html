<p>I am trying to figure out how creating a branch in git works with github. I created a branch on git called "Testing" and it appears to have shown up in github, but i am confused as to why it has any contents in the folders?

	<button>Here is a button</button>

<form action="working-on-terminal/testing.html">
	<button type="submit">Can I make a button that goes to the first page</button>
</form>
