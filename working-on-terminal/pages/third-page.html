<p>I am trying to figure out how creating a branch in git works with github. I created a branch on git called "Testing" and it appears to have shown up in github, but i am confused as to why it has any contents in the folders?

<footer> <a href="testing.html">Go to home</a><br>
	<a href="second-page.html">Go to second page</a><br>
	<a href="sacrifice.html">Go to fourth page</a><br>
	Not all of my links on this page are working. I seem to be having difficulty with local links. Wait, now that I removed the "pages/" for the links are working. I am still figuring out local and universal links.
